This script outputs filepath or user information depending
on the option the user specifies on the command line.

This script takes one option and one argument. The first a
flag allowing the user to specify to check filepath or user
information.  The second an object to act upon.

To execute the script type ./chk { -f filepath | -u user }

This script outputs:
When the -f flag is specified, filepath information is provided
detailing if the filepath exists or is a symbolic link.  If the
filepath exists, filepath permisions are printed.  If filepath
doesn't exist, script provides error message aned terminates.

When the -u flag is specified, if the user exists the user's
home directory is printed and if the user is currently logged.
If the user is not logged on, the last time the user was logged
on is printed.

This script uses error() and fatal() functions provided by Greg Boyd.
